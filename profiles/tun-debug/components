# This is the list of components to add to this profile.
#
# Be careful, the order matters! In general:
#   1) Put the "common" component first, always.
#   2) Put the daemon components (dropbear, tor, etc.)
#   3) Put the application components (jirafeau, etc.)
#
# That way the daemons can use the settings and files from "common",
# and the applications can use the settings and files from the daemons.

# Common component. Always goes first.
common
